# SFML_Game
This program is a continuation of my console version of the game. The goal of the game is to kill all opponents. There are three of them on the first level of difficulty: 
1. green - fires burst
2. yellow - shoots with a shot, i.e. 3 bullets per shot
3. red - shoots homing bullets 

The controls are simple, WSDA for movement and Space for shooting. 

For this game you need to download the [SFML library](../https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)

A small note, if your tank starts to tilt in any direction, just turn in the same direction and you will be fine. I don't know why this is happening, and if you have any versions, I will be glad to hear from you;)
